You don't know what's inside, but we call it **x**.\n\n## Example\n\nIf I say: **x + 3 = 5**\n\nThis means: \"What number plus 3 equals 5?\"\n\n🎯 **Answer:** x = 2 (because 2 + 3 = 5)\n\n## Why Learn Algebra?\n\n1. 🎮 Video game designers use it\n2. 🏗️ Architects need it for buildings\n3. 💰 Managing money uses algebra\n\n## Let's Try!\n\nPractice finding x in simple equations. Take your time - there's no rush!",

You get an idea of what's coming!\n\n## How to Preview\n\n### 1. Look at the Title 📌\nWhat does it tell you about the topic?\n\n### 2. Check the Pictures 🖼️\nImages give clues about the content.\n\n### 3. Read the Headings 📋\nHeadings are like mini-titles that organize information.\n\n### 4. Notice Bold Words ✨\nBold words are usually important vocabulary.\n\n## Why Preview?\n\n- Helps your brain prepare\n- Makes reading easier\n- Improves understanding\n- Helps you remember better\n\n## 🎯 Try It!\n\nBefore reading your next book, spend 2 minutes previewing.
